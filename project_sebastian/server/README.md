## Server - Apache

```bash
'apache2' - Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol Server
```

```bash
'apache2' is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol  (HTTP)  server  pro‚Äê
       gram.  It  is  designed  to be run as a standalone daemon process. When
       used like this it will create a pool of child processes or  threads  to
       handle requests.

       In  general,  apache2 should not be invoked directly, but rather should
       be invoked via /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl.  The  default  Debian
       configuration  requires  environment  variables  that  are  defined  in
       /etc/apache2/envvars and  are  not  available  if  apache2  is  started
       directly.   However, apache2ctl can be used to pass arbitrary arguments
       to apache2.

```
